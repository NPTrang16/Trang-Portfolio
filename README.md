# Hi there, welcome to Trang's Coding Journey! 👩🏻‍💻

I'm currently majoring in Applied Chemistry and plan to take the next step in my professional journey by combining Data Science and Chemistry. As a self-taught coder, I'm still developing my skills, but I love bringing my own original ideas to life through code. Thus, I'm excited to share creative personal projects I've developed. The topics may seem random, but each one is a way for me to explore, experiment, and learn more.

## Let's take a look at my projects:
- Turning a piano sheet into a Gaussian distribution
- Yes yes
