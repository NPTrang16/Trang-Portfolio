# Introduction 
I started playing the piano at the age of 6. Although I took a 6 year break, I'm now more passionate than ever. With the scientific knowledge I've gained throughout my education, I’ve started to wonder if I can understand music in mathematical terms.

## What's a MIDI file?
To get started, in music, a MIDI file (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a type of file which contains information about a song—such as which notes to play, their pitch (how high or low they are), and their velocity (how long or short they are played). Unlike MP3 or WAV files, MIDI files don’t contain actual audio. Instead, they store performance data, acting more like sheet music for digital instruments. <br/>

Today, I chose to work with a piano MIDI file of the main theme from one of my favorite movies, **Interstellar**, titled _Cornfield Chase_. The piece was composed by Hans Zimmer and [beautifully covered by Cosmic PIANO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57SdNVHYdNk) on YouTube. <br/>

Here's what its MIDI file sounds like: [Listen to MIDI Cornfield Chase](https://github.com/NPTrang16/Audios/blob/main/Cornfield%20Chase.mid)

## An overview of Mido
Mido, short for MIDI Objects, is a Python library designed to work with those MIDI files.
