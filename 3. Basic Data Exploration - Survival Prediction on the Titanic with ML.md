# Introduction
I recently discovered [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a website for Machine Learning. As I explored it, I decided to try to solve a challenge to get familiar with the basics of ML: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). </br>
</br>
The goal is to **use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck on April 15, 1912.**

## Datasets and Attributes
There are two main CSV files:
- `train.csv`, which contains data on 891 passengers, including whether they survived or not. This file will be used to train the machine.
- `test.csv `, which contains data on 417 passengers without survival information.

In order to make predictions for `test.csv`, the machine will analyze the following five attributes:
- `Pclass`: socio-economic class (ticket class)
- `Age`: in years
- `SibSp`: number of siblings and spouses the passenger went with during the trip.
- `Parch`: number of parents and children the passenger went with during the trip.
- `Fare`: price of a ticket. 

_To keep in mind: I still struggle finding a way to include `Sexe`, `Cabin` and `Embarked` as those attributes do have a big impact on the predictions. I'll definitely work on it._

## Machine Training
### Step 1: Importing the CSV file of known datas
````
import pandas as pd

titanic_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

titanic_data = titanic_data.dropna(axis=0) #not taking into account NA datas (non-available)
````
### Step 2: Feature selection 
````
y = titanic_data.Survived

survival_features = ['Pclass','Age','SibSp','Parch','Fare']
````
I selected numerical datas for simplicity.

### Step 3: Machine "Teaching"
````
x = titanic_data[survival_features]

x.head(5) #showing datas of first 5 passengers
````
Output: </br>
<img width="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aad3692c-38de-4fe3-b8a1-94a918843e19" /> </br>
Notice that some passengers are skipped, probably because they don't have enough datas (`dropna(axis=0)`).
### Step 4: Defining the Decision Tree Regression as a model
````
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

titanic_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1) 
titanic_model.fit(x,y)
````
`random_state=1` to control the random shuffling and splitting of data (reproducibility) </br>
Output: </br>
<img width="262" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6825fc3-35e3-42a7-98ea-98a6c6f5052f" />

### Step 5:  Importing the CSV file containing datas of new passengers and Predictions
````
new_passengers = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

new_passengers = new_passengers[survival_features]

predictions = titanic_model.predict(new_passengers)
print("Survival predictions for the new passengers:")
print(predictions)
````
Output: </br>
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5146db93-b4c4-403e-adf2-62814737975f" /> </br>
1 means the passenger survived. 0 means the other way. </br>
We can display this array as a table with the attributes: </br>
````
import numpy as np
predictions_array = np.array(predictions) 
new_passengers['Predicted Survival']  = predictions_array #adding "Predicted Survival" as a column to the DataFrame
new_passengers.head(10) #showing survival informations for the first 10 new passengers.
````
Output: </br>
<img width="329" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d342e43-46ef-48aa-8c17-4d9bab450072" /> </br>

## General informations about the new passengers
1) Number of survived passengers
````
survived = np.count_nonzero(predictions_array == 1)
print("Number of survived passengers:", survived)

Output: Number of survived passengers: 270
````
2) Average datas of survived passengers 
````
df_new_passengers = pd.DataFrame(new_passengers) #create a DataFrame for new passengers

survived_list = [] #create a list containing only datas of survived passengers

for i in range(len(predictions_array)):
    if predictions_array[i] == 1:
        survived_list.append(df_new_passengers.iloc[i]) #add the passenger to the list whenever they survived or not

df_survived = pd.DataFrame(survived_list) #create a DataFrame for survived passengers

print(df_survived.mean()) #print average datas of survived passengers
````
Output: </br>
<img width="184" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e82f703-3e43-446b-98b0-217115cf41b1" />

3) Average datas of died passengers </br>
Same as for survived passengers:
````
died_list = []

for i in range(len(predictions_array)):
    if predictions_array[i] == 0:
        died_list.append(df_new_passengers.iloc[i])
        

df_died = pd.DataFrame(died_list)

print(df_died.mean())
````
Output: </br>
<img width="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b3b78b0-5384-4977-bed3-8397643a9f3b" />
