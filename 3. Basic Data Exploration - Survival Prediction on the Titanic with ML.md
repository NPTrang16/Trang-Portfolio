# Introduction
I recently discovered [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a website for Machine Learning. As I explored it, I decided to try to solve a challenge to get familiar with the basics of ML: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). </br>
</br>
The goal is to **use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck on April 15, 1912.**

## Datasets and Attributes
There are two main CSV files:
- `train.csv`, which contains data on passengers, including whether they survived or not. This file will be used to train the machine.
- `test.csv `, which contains data on passengers without survival information.

In order to make predictions for `test.csv`, the machine will analyze the following five attributes:
- `Pclass`: socio-economic class (ticket class)
- `Age`: in years
- `SibSp`: number of siblings and spouses the passenger went with during the trip.
- `Parch`: number of parents and children the passenger went with during the trip.
- `Fare`: price of a ticket. 

_To keep in mind: I still struggle finding a way to include `Sexe`, `Cabin` and `Embarked` as those attribute do have a big impact on the predictions. I'll definitely work on it_

## Machine Training
### Step 1: Importing the CSV file of known datas
````
import pandas as pd

titanic_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

titanic_data = titanic_data.dropna(axis=0)
````
### Step 2: Feature selection 
````
y = titanic_data.Survived

survival_features = ['Pclass','Age','SibSp','Parch','Fare']
````
I selected numerical datas for simplicity.

### Step 3: Machine "Teaching"
````
x = titanic_data[survival_features]

x.head(5) #showing datas of first 5 passengers
````
Output: </br>

### Step 4: Defining the Decision Tree Regression as a model
````
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

titanic_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1) 
titanic_model.fit(x,y)
````
`random_state=1` to control the random shuffling and splitting of data (reproducibility)
Output: </br>
<img width="262" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6825fc3-35e3-42a7-98ea-98a6c6f5052f" />

### Step 5:  Importing the CSV file containing datas of new passengers and Predictions
````
new_passengers = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

new_passengers = new_passengers[survival_features]

predictions = titanic_model.predict(new_passengers)
print("Survival predictions for the new passengers:")
print(predictions)
````
Output: </br>
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5146db93-b4c4-403e-adf2-62814737975f" /> </br>
1 means the passenger survived. 0 means the other way. </br>
We can display this array as a table:
