# Case study
In the universe of the series **Attack on Titan** (AoT), created by its author Hajime Isayama, humanity is threatened by giant, aggressive man-eating humanoids known as [Titans](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Titan). To protect themselves, they built massive walls similar to the Great Wall of China, and the only military unit brave enough to step outside to fight the Titans was the [Survey Corps](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Survey_Corps). </br>
</br>
However, simply killing those mindless monsters did not provide more information about the Titans itself, so the 14th commander of the Corps, Hange ZoÃ«, had the risky idea of capturing alive at least one and bringing it within the safety of the walls. She then conducted a scientific research about **Titans behavior** in order to extract valuable information about them. 

_ðŸ’¡ To keep in mind: Since the series barely showed the study, I came up with the idea of turning this detail into something useful and exploitable for my Data Mining learning process. The following exercise and its instructions were inspired by the [introduction to Mlxtend published by Mlxtend](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/apriori/#example-1-generating-frequent-itemsets)._

## Study conditions
After successfully capturing 8 Titans of various sizes and imprisoning them in a huge cage (which is technically impossible in the AoT universe), Hange's team recorded the observed behaviors of each one. Each Titan exhibited a certain set of behaviors, for example: </b>
- Screaming (A)
- Banging its head against the cage (B)
- Running around the cage (C)
- Sitting still in one place (D)
- Speaking human language (E) </b>

### Generating Frequent Behavior Sets
I asked ChatGPT to create a dataset of Titan behaviors based on the accurate events of the series:</b>

| Titan | Behavior Set  |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | AC            |
| 2     | AB            |
| 3     | ABC           |
| 4     | CE            |
| 5     | AC            |
| 6     | ABD           |
| 7     | CD            |
| 8     | AE            |

*Table: Titan Behaviors Dataset* </br>
</br>
Let's put it in Python.
````
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder #

dataset = [['Screaming','Running'],
           ['Screaming','Banging head'],
           ['Screaming','Banging head','Running'],
           ['Running','Speaking'],
           ['Screaming','Running'],
           ['Screaming','Banging head','Sitting still'],
           ['Running', 'Sitting still'],
           ['Screaming','Speaking']]
````
### Frequent Behavior Sets

We set `min_support` at 10% (low) to avoid missing any potential valuable informations.
````
te = TransactionEncoder() #creating an encoder object called te.
te_ary = te.fit(dataset).transform(dataset) #scanning dataset and transforming each data into an array of True/False.
df = pd.DataFrame(te_ary, columns=te.columns_) #by using pandas, the encoded array is now a table with ABCDE columns.

apriori(df, min_support=0.1, use_colnames=True) #performing the Apriori algorithm to identify behavior sets that appear in at least 10% of the Titans.

frequent_itemsets[ (frequent_itemsets['length'] >= 2) & #only take in count itemsets containing more than 2 items that appear in at least 10% of the Titans.
                   (frequent_itemsets['support'] >= 0.1) ]
````
Here's the output after running the code:

|        | support       |itemsets                                |length|
|------- |---------------|----------------------------------------|------|
| 5      | 0.125         |(Banging head, Running)                 |  2   |
| 6      | 0.375         |(Banging head, Screaming)               |  2   |
| 7      | 0.125         |(Banging head, Sitting still)           |  2   |
| 8      | 0.375         |(Screaming, Running)                    |  2   |
| 9      | 0.125         | (Running, Sitting still)               |  2   |
| 10     | 0.125         |(Speaking, Running)                     |  2   |
| 11     | 0.125         |(Screaming, Sitting still)              |  2   |
| 12     | 0.125         | (Screaming, Speaking)                  |   2  |
| 13     | 0.125         |(Banging head, Running, Screaming)      |   3  |
| 14     | 0.125         |(Banging head, Screaming, Sitting still)|   3  |

We can also narrow the scope by changing `min_support=0.2`

|        | support       |itemsets                                |length|
|------- |---------------|----------------------------------------|------|
| 6      | 0.375         |(Banging head, Screaming)               |  2   |
| 8      | 0.375         |(Screaming, Running)                    |  2   |

### Interpretation
"If the Titan is `banging its head` against the cage, it will also `scream`. If the Titan is `screaming`, it will also `run`." </br>
Given such a correlation, Hange's team might need to build a more durable cage and wear more effective ear protection. </br>
As we can see, behaviors like `Sitting still` and `Speaking` are not frequent, as they are typically exhibited by Abnormal Titans in the series. Pure and mindless Titans are more common, that's why.
