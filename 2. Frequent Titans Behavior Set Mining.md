# Case study
In the universe of the series **Attack on Titan** (AoT), created by its author Hajime Isayama, humanity is threatened by giant, man-eating humanoids known as [Titans](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Titan). To protect themselves, they built massive walls similar to the Great Wall of China, and the only military unit brave enough to step outside to fight the Titans was the [Survey Corps](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Survey_Corps). </br>
</br>
However, simply killing those mindless monsters did not provide more information about the Titans itself, so the 14th commander of the Corps, Hange ZoÃ«, had the risky idea of capturing alive at least one and bringing it within the safety of the walls. She then conducted a scientific research about **Titans behavior** in order to extract valuable information about them. 

_ðŸ’¡ To keep in mind: Since the series barely showed the study, I came up with the idea of turning this detail into something useful and exploitable for my Data Mining learning process. The following exercise and its instructions were inspired by a worksheet from [Utrecht University](https://ics-websites.science.uu.nl/docs/vakken/mdm/dm2020-exc-freqpat.pdf)._

## Study conditions
After successfully capturing 8 Titans of various sizes and imprisoning them in a huge cage (which is technically impossible in the AoT universe), Hange's team recorded the observed behaviors of each one. Each Titan exhibited a certain set of behaviors, for example: </b>
- Screaming (A)
- Banging its head against the cage (B)
- Running around the cage (C)
- Sitting still in one place (D)
- Speaking human language (E) </b>

I asked ChatGPT to create a dataset of Titan behaviors based on the accurate events of the series:</b>

| Titan | Behavior Set  |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | AC            |
| 2     | AB            |
| 3     | ABC           |
| 4     | CE            |
| 5     | AC            |
| 6     | ABD           |
| 7     | CD            |
| 8     | AE            |
